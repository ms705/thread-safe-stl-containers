Plain and simple, thread safe versions of the standard c++ libraries.  All that this is is essentially a wrapper around the STL containers.

To use this code you will need Boost and the STL.

The API for my code is exactly the same as it is for the standard containers, however my code is contained under the namespace thread\_safe.

This code is BSD licensed, but I'd appreciate if you report it if you find any bugs.
